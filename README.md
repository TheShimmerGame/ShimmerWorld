# Installation
This project uses CMake together with vcpkg (manifest mode).
The vcpkg tool itself is downloaded, compiled, and automatically bootstrapped through CMake.
Once vcpkg is set up, project dependencies (libraries) are downloaded and managed by vcpkg.
Use one of the provided CMake presets via CLI or CMake GUI.
Currently, only Windows presets are available.
Because the project uses Clang, Linux-focused presets will be added in the future.
